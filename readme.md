## Company Overview 

Founded in 2014, KOHO Financial (“Koho”, “the company”) is a Toronto-based FinTech startup that serves as a one-stop shop for personal financial services for millennials. With a business consulting background and entrepreneurial mindset, Daniel Eberhard, the founder cum CEO of Koho, quickly realized that Canadian customers are among those who have to bear the highest banking fees in the world and that they demand more affordable, accessible, transparent, and less expensive banking services. With that vision, Koho officially launched a beta version in 2015 and quickly became an eminent growing startup. Koho offers millennials a no-fee spending banking account with instant cashback with various tools which help to manage personal finance better.

Koho now serves approximately 400,000 users for day-to-day banking services, expanded the team to 200 employees. The company received total funding of $113.4 million via several debts and equity financing from 16 investors, of which two strategic investors are Drive Capital and Portag3 Ventures. The post-money valuation of the company in the nearest round is estimated to be $300 million. 

## Business Activities

### <b> Pain point that Koho tries to solve and its key market segments </b>

Canadian banks are failing to serve Canadian customers. Five big banks control 90% market share and only focus on profit by cutting branches and services to reduce cost, lowering the interest rates, and charging high fees. The average Canadian has to pay between $150 and $200 a year, which is among the highest in the world for banking services. Despite high fees, services are still less accessible and inconvenient due to the long waiting process. Millennials and Gen Z are among those who are reluctant to use traditional banking services due to a lack of time and money.  They usually have a banking account but the engagement level is low level for both spending and lending activities.

The target segment of Koho is millennials and young users who are frustrated with the long process by the traditional banks and are very sensitive to fees. These customers are usually the most tech-savvy users who are opened minded, familiar with using app and technology and love the convenience that technology brings for them. Most importantly they are the ones spending and lending the most for day-to-day activities.

n Canada, there are nearly 10 million people from the age of 18-34 who belong to the targeted market of Koho . These numbers will continue to rise due to the increase in immigration activities. Besides the Canadian market, Koho also aims at expanding to Latin America and Southeast Asia.
